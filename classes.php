      Learn to make your first pair of socks!  In this three-week class, Ann will teach you to knit a sock from the cuff down, and you’ll walk away prepared to tackle almost any sock pattern out there.  By the end of the class, you will know how to work a heel flap, turn a heel using short rows, pick up stitches for the gusset, and work a toe.  We generally start with a worsted weight pattern for the class, but you can certainly use a lighter weight pattern and yarn if you are feeling speedy!
